The pickle module is used for implementing binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. 
Pickling: It is a process where a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream. 
Unpickling: It is the inverse of the Pickling process where a byte stream is converted into an object hierarchy.
